# text_historical_authenticity_evaluation
A study on the historical authenticity of a text. The historical authenticity is evaluated by comparing the frequencies of unigrams, bigrams and trigrams of a given text to the frequencies of the ngrams of texts written in the period of +/- 5 years from the claimed date of the release of the given text and to the frequency of the ngrams of recent texts. A tool to visualise the findings made with pandas and matplotlib-pyplot is included.
